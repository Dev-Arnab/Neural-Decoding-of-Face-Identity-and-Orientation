# Neural-Decoding-of-Face-Identity-and-Orientation
Investigating linear neural coding in the primate Anterior Medial (AM) face patch. This pipeline uses Logistic and Ridge Regression to compare discrete feature classification (80% accuracy) against continuous head angle prediction (99.81° RMSE error), establishing key findings on face encoding strategies.
